# Setup

## Installation

Run the following command from the root folder of the cloned project to install all dependencies.

`npm install`

## Verify Setup

In order to verify that everything is setup correctly, run the following command, which should show you the failing tests. This is good! We'll be fixing these tests once we jump into the build step.

`npm run test`

Every time you want to check your work locally you can type that command, and it will report the status of every task in that module.

As you move through the modules, you can run module-specific tests with the script `npm run test:module1`, replacing the number with one that corresponds with the module you are working in.

You can also run a visual test using the command `npm run visual:module1`, replacing the number with one that corresponds with the module you are working in.

## Previewing Your Work

In order to see your changes in a browser, you can run `npm start` from the command line. This will open a browser and you should see your landing page.

# Module 01 - Utility Classes

## 1.1 - Container

@container To center content in the body of the page we'll need to create a container that is positioned and styled in CSS and then this class will be applied to several HTML elements in our `index.html`. 

To start, in the 'css/main.css' file create a `.container` class that sets the `top` and `bottom` margins to `0` and the `left` and `right` to `auto`. 

Set the `max-width` to `1170px`.

## 1.2 - Container Class Attribute

@container-class-attribute This task applies the CSS that you wrote in the previous step so that you can see how it affects the rendered HTML.  This is a pattern that you'll be following often in this project - write some CSS, then apply it to HTML. 

Add the `container` class that was just created to the following HTML elements in `index.html`:

- First `<div>` in the `<nav>`
- First `<div>` in the `<!-- HERO -->` `<section>`.
- First `<div>` in the `<!-- MAIN CONTAINER -->` block.
- The first `<section>` in the `<footer>`

## 1.3 - Sections as Flex Containers

@sections-flex Make each `<section>` element in the `index.html`  file a `flex` container by setting the `display` property to the correct value.

## 1.4 - Flex Utilities

@flex-utilities The layout of this landing page will be done using CSS flexbox. Instead of repeating ourselves across our classes we will pull the more commonly used properties into their own classes. Below you will find three classes and the properties they should contain. Create these three classes below the section rule just created.

- `.flex` - `display: flex`
- `.flex-column` - `flex-direction: column`
- `.flex-one` - `flex: 1`

## 1.5 - Flex Class Attribute 

@flex-utilities-class-attribute Now, apply the `flex` utility class to several HTML elements in the `index.html` file: 

`flex`
- First `<div>` in the `<nav>`.
- First `<div>` in the `<!-- BRANDING -->` block.
- First `<div>` in the `<!-- SEARCH -->` block.
- First `<ul>` in the `<!-- SEARCH -->` block.
- First and second `<div>`'s in the `<!-- PROFILE -->` block.
- First `<div>` in the `<!-- HERO -->` `<section>`.
- First `<div>` in the `<!-- SALE BANNER -->` `<section>`.
- Second `<div>` in the `<!-- FULL BANNER -->` `<section>`.
- First `<div>` in the `<!-- PS DEMO -->` `<section>`.

## 1.6 - Flex Column and Flex One Class Attributes

@flex-column-one-class-attributes Now, apply the `flex-column` and `flex-one` utility classes to these HTML elements in `index.html` : 

`flex-column`

- First nested `<div>` in the `<!-- PROFILE -->` block.
- First `<div>` in the `<!-- HERO -->` `<section>`.
- Second `<div>` in the `<!-- FULL BANNER -->` `<section>`.
- First `<div>` in the `<!-- PS DEMO -->` `<section>`.

`flex-one`

- First `<div>` in the `<!-- SEARCH -->` block.

## 1.7 - Alignment Flex Utilities

@flex-alignment-utilities To adjust the positioning and alignment of individual elements within a flex container, let's create three additional classes in `main.css`:

- `.align-center` - `align-items: center`
- `.center` - `justify-content: center`
- `.space-between` - `justify-content: space-between`


## 1.8 - Alignment Flex Utilities Class Attributes

@flex-alignment-utilities-class-attributes We will apply these new alignment flex classes to several HTML elements in the `index.html` file: 

`align-center`

- First `<div>` in the `<!-- BRANDING -->` block.
- First `<div>` in the `<!-- SEARCH -->` block.
- First `<div>` in the `<!-- PROFILE -->` block.
- First `<div>` in the `<!-- HERO -->` `<section>`.
- First `<div>` in the `<!-- SALE BANNER -->` `<section>`.
- Second `<div>` in the `<!-- FULL BANNER -->` `<section>`.
- First `<div>` in the `<!-- PS DEMO -->` `<section>`.

## 1.9 - Space Between Utilities Class Attributes

@flex-space-between-utilities-class-attribute We will apply these new alignment flex classes to several HTML elements in the `index.html` file: 

`center`
- First `<div>` in the `<!-- HERO -->` `<section>`.
- First `<div>` in the `<!-- SALE BANNER -->` `<section>`.
- Second `<div>` in the `<!-- FULL BANNER -->` `<section>`.

`space-between`
- First `<div>` in the `<nav>`.
- First `<ul>` in the `<!-- SEARCH -->` block.
- First `<section>` in the `<footer>`.

## 1.10 - Buttons

@button-utilities Each button will have a consistent look and feel. With `main.css` still open, add the class `.btn` with the following styles:
- add a cursor
- remove any borders
- padding should be `6px` top and bottom and `12px` left and right
- Round the corners by `3px`
- change the line height to `1.4`

Also, Create two different button styles `btn-default` and `btn-primary`. The color of the text for both should be `white`. The `btn-default` background color is `#faa541`. The `btn-primary` background color should be `#364147`.

## 1.11 - Buttons Class Attribute

@button-utilities-class-attribute In `index.html`, find the only `<a>` element in the `<!-- FULL BANNER -->` block. Give this element the `.btn` class and the button `default` class.

Then, Find the sign up `<button>` element in the `<footer>`.
Give this element the `btn` class and the button `primary` class.

## 1.12 - Form Controls

@form-controls We only have a few form controls, but let's make a custom class for them anyway. Add a new class called `.form-control` below the button classes in `main.css`.

This class should change the `display` to `block`, and add padding of `6px` top/bottom and `12px` left/right. Next, add a 1px solid border with a stroke color of `#a0a0a0`. The text in the control should have a color of `#8598a2`. Finally, add a line height of `1.4`.

## 1.13 - Form Controls Class Attribute

@form-controls-class-attribute Find the `<input>` element with the `placeholder` of `Enter email address` in the `<footer>` element in the `index.html` file. Add the `form-control` class to the `<input>`.

## 1.14 - Typography

@typography-utilities There are some base typographic styles we'll use throughout the page. 

In the main stylesheet, below the `.form-control` class, add three classes: `.text-light`, `.text-secondary`, and `.text-primary`.

The light class should have a font size of `30px` and a color of `#a0a0a0`. 

The secondary font size is also `30px` and the color is `#faa541`.

The primary class needs a font size of `16px` and a color of `#364147`. 

## 1.15 - Typography Class Attributes

@typography-utilities-class-attributes These are the required `index.html` modifications. Add the class listed to the correct element.

`text-light`

- `<div>` with contents `Couples retreat weekend`

`text-secondary`

- `<div>` with contents `Save an extra 20%`

## 1.16 - Typography Primary Style Class Attribute

@typography-utilities-primary-class-attribute Finally, add the class `text-primary` to these elements in the `index.html` file:

- `<div>` with contents `when you buy 2 pairs of boots`
- `<div>` in footer with contents `Customer Support`
- `<div>` in footer with contents `Company Info`
- `<div>` in footer with contents `Privacy &amp; Terms`
- `<div>` in footer with contents `Follow Us`
- `<div>` in footer with contents `&copy;Pluralsight 2018`

# Module 02 - Header & Navigation

## 2.1 - Header

@header The header of the page has several elements. In this task, we'll style the general header as well as the logo.

Open `main.css`, and below the other styles create a class called `.header-nav` that adds a `1px` bottom border with the color `#a0a0a0`.

## 2.2 - Brand

@brand Next, setup a class called `.brand`  below the `.header-nav`  class that sets the element size to `170x85` pixels. Adjust the `left` margin by negative `15` pixels and the right margin by `60` pixels.

## 2.3 - Logo

@logo The logo needs to fit within the `170x85` container. To do this, create a `.logo` class that sets the `max-width` to `100%` and the `height` to `auto`. 

## 2.4 - Header, Branding, and Logo Class Attributes

@header-branding-logo-class-attributes Switch over to `index.html`  and we'll apply these newly created header and branding classes to the correct elements.

Apply the `header-nav` class to the `<nav>`. 

Find the `<!-- BRANDING -->` block and apply the `brand` class to the first `<div>` in the block. 

Then, apply the `logo` class to the `<img>` tag with the `src` of `img/carved-rock-logo.png`.

## 2.5 - Search Box

@search-box Lets get back to work on the styles on the next header element the search box. Create a new class below the existing styles called `.search-box`. The search box needs to be sized to `330x30` with `6px` padding top/bottom and `12px` left/right. Finally, give the search box a full `1px` border colored `#a0a0a0`. 

## 2.6 - Search Button

@search-button Another element of the header is the search button. Create a class called `.search-button`. The background color of the button should be `#a0a0a0` and the text color should be white(`#ffffff`). 

Its size should be `100x30` pixels and the `border` and `padding` should be reset to `0`. **Hint: It is best practice to use `0` without the `px` unit.**

## 2.7 - Search Class Attributes

@search-class-attributes Find the `<!-- SEARCH -->` block in the `index.html` file. Apply the `search-box` class to the text `<input>` and the `search-button` class to the `<button>` element.

## 2.8 - Navigation List

@navigation-list For the `.nav-list` class, zero out the left `padding`. Adjust the `width` of the list to `575px`. Add a top `margin` of `10px`. 

## 2.9 - Navigation List Links

@navigation-list-links The `.nav-list` links (`li a`) should be selected and given the following font properties, `16px`, `uppercase`, `700` weight, with a letter spacing of `0.2px`.

## 2.10 - Navigation List Class Attribute

@navigation-list-class-attribute In `index.html`, locate the `<ul>` in the search block. Give this element a class of `nav-list`.

## 2.11 - Profile

@profile To style the profile section of the header we need two different classes. Name them `.profile` and `.account`. The only declaration in the `.profile` class should set the left margin to `auto`. The `.account` class should adjust the alignment on the text to the right, have a full `padding` of `15px`, and a font color and size of `#364147` and `18px`.

Finally, select all the links that are descendant of all elements with a class of `.account`. Overwrite the `font-size`, set it to  `14px`.

## 2.12 - Profile Picture

@profile-picture We'll round the profile picture and size it down. Create a class called `.profile-pic` in `main.css`. Make the size of the profile picture container `60x60`. Then create a rule that selects the all descendant `img` elements of `.profile-pic`. To round the image set the `border-radius` to `100px`. Make sure the image fits in the container set `max-width` to `100%`.

## 2.13 - Profile Class Attribute

@profile-class-attribute We have three classes to apply in `index.html` - `.profile`, `.account`, and `.profile-pic`.

In the `<!-- PROFILE -->` block assign the first `<div>` the class `profile`. Add the `account` class to the nested `<div>`. Finally, give the `<div>` that surrounds the image with an `src` of `img/profile-pic.jpg` the `profile-pic` class.

# Module 03 - Hero, Sales Banner, & Categories

## 3.1 - Hero Section

@hero-section Moving further down the page, let's focus on styling the hero image and text. 

For the image, construct a class called `.hero` that adjusts several background properties. 

Center the image horizontally and vertically using `background-position`. 

Set `background-size` to `cover`, height to `400px` and `background-image` to `url('../img/hero.jpg')`.

Finally, transform the text to `uppercase`. 

## 3.2 - Hero Headings

@hero-headings To create a more visually appealing hero section we'll add some styling to the `<h1>` and `<h2>` elements. 

First, create a rule that selects the `<h1>` in the `.hero <div>`. Have that rule adjust the position of that `<div>` by making it relative and then move it to the left by -30px.

Select all `<h2>` elements in the `.hero <div>` and change the text color to `#faa541`. 
  
Next, select both the `<h1>` and `<h2>` elements in the `.hero <div>` and set a few properties to make them consistent.
 
Adjust the font size to `63px`, bump up the font weight to `700`, and set the `line-height` to `0.9`.

## 3.3 - Hero Paragraph

@hero-paragraph Now, let's change the paragraph element to match the `<h1>` and `<h2>` elements. Select all `<p>` elements in the `.hero <div>` and change these font properties: letter spacing to `2px`, font weight to `700`, font size to `21px`. For this element's `margin`, zero out the top, left and right. Add `10px` to the bottom. **Hint: Using the 3 value shorthand for `margin`.**

## 3.4 - Hero Class Attribute

@hero-class-attribute Open the `index.html` file and locate the first `<section>` after the `<nav>` and apply a class attribute of `hero`.

## 3.5 - Banner Container and Image

@banner-container-image The sales banner is the first thing in the main content area of the page. Let's draw attention to it. 

First, create a class called `.banner` and adjust the `margin` of the container set it to `55px 15px`. The banner is the full width of its parent so set `width` to `100%`. To set the banner apart from the rest of the content set the top border to `1px solid #a0a0a0` and the bottom border to `1px solid #a0a0a0`. Give each element some spacing by setting `padding` to `25px 0`.

Fix the `width` of the images to `250px` by selecting all `img` elements that are descendants of the element with a class of `.banner`.

## 3.6 - Banner Text

@banner-text Transform the text in the sales banner by constructing a rule that has a selector of `.banner-text`. Change these text properties:

- `font-size` - `30px`
- `font-weight` - `700`
- `text-transform` - `uppercase`
- `line-height` - `1`
- `text-align` - `center`

## 3.7 - Banner Text Last Child

@banner-text-last-child The text of the last div in the sales banner is a bit smaller than the other lines. Create a rule that selects the `<div>` using the `>` selector and the `:last-child` pseudo selector, and make sure it is a descendant of the `.banner-text` element. The rule should set the font size to `16px`, font weight to `400` and add a top margin of `5px`.

## 3.8 - Banner and Banner Text Class Attributes

@banner-class-attributes Add the class `banner` to the first `<div>` in the `<!-- SALES BANNER -->` `<section>`. In this `<div>`, find the first `<div>` after the image and give it a class of `banner-text`.

## 3.9 - Category

@category After the sales banner we'll create a four column grid using the `flex` property.

Create a rule with a selector of `.category`, set `flex` to `0 0 25%`. This will divide the space evenly in four columns. 

We need to add a gap between the columns so set `padding` to `0 15px`. 

The images in these columns should be full width. Create a rule that selects the `<img>` elements that are descendants of any `.category` element and set `width` to `100%`.

## 3.10 - Category Text

@category-text The text of each category should have the following properties declared in a rule with the selector `.category-text`: 

- `color` - `#364147`
- `padding` - `30px 0`
- `text-transform` - `uppercase`
- `text-align` - `center` 

## 3.11 - Category Text Divs

@category-text-divs All `<div>`'s that are children(`>`) of a `.category-text` element should have the font properties: 

- `font-size` - `16px`
- `font-weight` - `200` 
- `color` - `#faa541`

## 3.12 - Category Headings

@category-headings All `<h3>` headings that are descendants of a `.category-text` element should have the font properties: 

- `font-size` - `30px`
- `font-weight` - `700` 
- `line-height` - `1`

## 3.13 - Category Class Attributes

@category-class-attributes Open `index.html` and locate the `<!-- CATEGORIES -->` block. 

There are four top-level `<div>` elements in a `<section>`. Give each of these a `category` class. 

Next, find the `<div>`'s after each image in the `category <div>'s` and apply a class of `category-text`.

# Module 04 - Full Banner

## 4.1 - Full Banner Container

@full-banner-container After the categories, we'll create a Full Banner for Trail Reviews. It will have a picture covering 60% of the main container and a sidebar covering the rest. 

To start, create a `.full-banner` class that sets some box model properties. Set `padding` to `0 15px`,and `margin` to `50px 0`. Set the `position` to `relative` so that we can create an inset border next. 

## 4.2 - Full Banner Border

@full-banner-border For the border, we'll use the `.full-banner` class selector and the pseudo-class `:before`. Because we're using `:before`, set `content` to `""` so there is something to style. Next, set the border to `1px solid #ffffff`.

Because we used `relative` positioning for the `.full-banner`, we can use absolute positioning in this rule. Set `position` to `absolute`. With this set, we can adjust the top, bottom, left and right. Use, `30px`,  `30px`,  `50px`,  `50px` respectively. Bring the border to the front using `z-index: 1`.

## 4.3 - Full Banner Image

@full-banner-image Next, let's use the flex property to have the image take up 60% of the width of the banner. Set `flex` to `0 0 58.333333%` in a rule with a selector of `.full-banner-image`. 

Set background size, image, and position to `url('../img/vista.jpg')`, `cover`, and `top center`, respectively. Set the minimum height of the image to `400px`.

## 4.4 - Full Banner Sidebar

@full-banner-sidebar The text of the banner is on the right and takes up 40% of the width of the banner, so use flex: 0 0 41.666667% in a rule with a selector of .full-banner-sidebar to adjust this. 

Add a few more declarations to the rule that transform the text to uppercase and color it white.

To finish the sidebar set the following properties:

- `background-color` - `#364147`
- `padding` - `30px`

## 4.5 - Full Banner Sidebar Heading

@full-banner-sidebar-heading Style the `<h4>` heading in the full banner by creating a rule with a selector of `.full-banner-sidebar h4` and adding these font declarations - size(`40px`), weight(`700`), style(`italic`), color(`#637f94`), and overwrite the line height(`1`).

## 4.6 - Full Banner Sidebar Text Decoration

@full-banner-sidebar-text-decoration Let's create a decorative element after the heading. This element will be after the `.full-banner-sidebar h4` element. Add the `:after` pseudo class  to this selector to create a rule with the following declarations: 

- `content` - `""`
- `width` & `height` - `100x1` pixels
- `background-color` - `#faa541`
- `margin` - `20px auto`
- `display` - `block`

## 4.7 - Full Banner Sidebar Text Styling

@full-banner-sidebar-styling For the text below the heading we're going to adjust a few properties. Select the first `<div>` in the side bar using the group of selectors `.full-banner-sidebar > div:nth-of-type(1)`, and set the following: 

- `font-size` - `60px`
- `font-weight` - `700`
- `line-height` - `1`

Select the second `<div>` in the side bar using the group of selectors `.full-banner-sidebar > div:nth-of-type(2)`:

- `font-size` - `25px`
- `font-weight` - `200`
- `letter-spacing` - `3px`

## 4.8 - Full Banner Sidebar Button

@full-banner-sidebar-button Finally, let's create a rule to style the button in the sidebar. Select the button using any method and add these declarations - a top margin of `50px`, make the text `uppercase` and change the letter spacing to `1px`. Make sure the button is first in the stacking order by changing the `z-index` to `1`. 

## 4.9 - Full Banner Class Attributes

@full-banner-class-attributes Locate the `<!-- FULL BANNER -->` block in the `index.html` file. Give the `<section>` in this block the class `full-banner`. Give the first `<div>` the class of `full-banner-image` and the second `<div>` a class of `full-banner-sidebar`.

# Module 05 - Footer

## 5.1 - Footer

@footer The footer completes the landing page. It is divided into two sections - the footer links and a demonstration message. 

To style, the footer select the `<footer>` element and make it a flex container with `flex-wrap` enabled(`wrap`). Set `position` to `relative`, `z-index` to `0`, and minimum height to `330px`. Make the background color `black`. 

## 5.2 - Footer Sidebar

@footer-sidebar Dynamically set the content after the footer to `""`. **Hint: Use the `:after` pseudo-class.**

Set the background color of the sidebar to `#a0a0a0` and set the width to `75%`.

Set the `position` of the element to `absolute`. Now that the element is `absolute`, set top, bottom, left and right to `0`. Finally set `z-index` to `-1`.

## 5.3 - Lists

@lists All of the content contained in the footer is in unordered lists. To equally space these lists, create a `.lists` rule and set `flex` to `0 0 75%`. Add a gap between these columns that adds up to `30px`(left/right - `15px`). The top and bottom should be set to `40px`.

## 5.4 - Link Headers

@link-headers Each list has a header, so create a rule with a selector of `.link-header` and transform the text to `uppercase`. Set the font size to `16px` and font weight to `700`. Change the bottom margin to `15px`.

## 5.5 - Links
@links The anchor tags in the footer should receive the styling:
`white` text color, `uppercase`, font size of `12px`, and the padding should be set to `0 0 4px`. Whenever the link is hovered over set `text-decoration` to `underline`.

## 5.6 - Link Class Attributes

@link-class-attributes The first `<section>` in the 
`<footer>` should be given a class of `lists`. Add the `link-header` class to the following elements: 

- `<div>` in footer with contents `Customer Support`
- `<div>` in footer with contents `Company Info`
- `<div>` in footer with contents `Privacy &amp; Terms`
- `<div>` in footer with contents `Follow Us`

## 5.7 - Social Links

@social-links To help style the social links in the footer, create a rule that has a selector of `.social ul li` and sets the display to `inline-block`. 

The links in the social list (`.social ul li a`), should have the following styles: 

- `display` - `block`
- `width` and `height` - `23px`
- background size and position - `23px 23px` `center`

## 5.8 - Social Icons

@social-icons There are five anchor tags in the `<ul>` in the `Follow Us` list. These links will have icons for social media platforms. Create five classes `.twitter`, `.facebook`, `.instagram`, and `.pinterest`. Each rule should have a single declaration of `background-image`. Set this to the correct URL for each image. **Hint: Look in the `img` directory.**

## 5.9 - Social Class Attributes

@social-class-attributes Give the last `<div>` in the `<footer>` `<section>` the class `social`. Then, find the `<ul>` under the `Follow Us` `<div>`. To the first `<a>` apply the `twitter` class, second apply `facebook`, third apply `instagram`, and fourth apply `pinterest`.

## 5.10 - Newsletter Headers

@newsletter-headers Below the social icons there is a newsletter section. This block has two `<div>`'s that need styling. Create two rules, one that has the properties:

- `font-size` - `12px` 
- `font-weight` - `400`
- `margin-bottom` - `5px`

A second that has a font style(`italic`), size(`12px`), weight(`400`), and a bottom margin(`15px`).

## 5.11 - Newsletter Form

@newsletter-form In this newsletter section there is also an `<input>` and a `<button>`. The `<input>` should have a `border` of `1px solid #364147`,  `width` of `200px` and bottom margin of `10px`

The button needs the following styles: 
- `width` - `150px`
- `min-width` - `auto`
- `text-transform` - `uppercase`
- `letter-spacing` - `1px`

## 5.12 - Newsletter Class Attributes

@newsletter-class-attributes Apply all of the necessary classes you have built to the appropriate newsletter HTML elements. 

## 5.13 - Pluralsight Demo Container

@pluralsight-demo-container The final section of the page is a notification that this site was made for demonstration purpose only. To style it, create a rule that has a selector of `.ps`, and add the following properties: 
 
- `flex` - `0 0 25%`
- `padding` - `40px 0`
- `color` - `#e5e5e5`
- `font-size` - `16px`

The Pluralsight logo in this section should have a `max-width` of `230px`.

## 5.14 - Pluralsight Demo Styles

@pluralsight-demo-styles Create a rule with the selector `.demo`  
and add a padding of `0 30px`. Before this `demo` section (`.demo:before`) add these properties: 

- `content` - `""`
- `display` - `block`
- `width` - `100%`
- `height` - `1px`
- `margin` - `30px 0`
- `background` - `linear-gradient(to right,#f05a28 0,#e80a89 100%)`

## 5.15 - Copyright

@copyright The final piece of the footer is the copyright. Create this one last rule, the selector `.copyright`, with the properties - flex(`0 0 75%`), padding(`10px 0`), font size(`12px`), and `center` align the text.

## 5.16 - Pluralsight Demo Class Attributes

@pluralsight-demo-class-attributes Locate the `<!-- PS DEMO -->` block in the `index.html` file. Give the `<section>` in this block the class `ps`. Give the nested `<div>` the class of `demo`. Give the copyright `<div>` the class of `copyright`.
